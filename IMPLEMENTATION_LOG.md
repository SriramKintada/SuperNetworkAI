### Reference Documents
- ✅ AI Agent Debugging Playbook read and understood
- 📄 TDD document available (will reference as needed)
- 📄 PRD document available (will reference as needed)

### Files Created
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md` - Setup verification checklist
- Empty directories: `docs/`, `scripts/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/functions/`, `supabase/seed/`

### Environment Setup Required
Before Phase 1 can begin, the following must be completed:
1. Supabase project created and linked
2. Environment variables configured (.env.local)
3. Supabase CLI installed and authenticated
4. API keys obtained (OpenAI, Anthropic)

See `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md` for complete setup instructions.

## 📦 Phase 1: Foundation - Database Schema + Auth

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Status:** 🚧 Created, Awaiting Deployment

### ✅ Files Created

1. **`.env.local`** - Environment configuration
   - Supabase URL and anon key
   - OpenAI API key
   - Project reference

2. **`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`** (373 lines)
   - Created 9 tables:
     - `profiles` - User profiles with intent, skills, visibility
     - `profile_embeddings` - 1536-dim vectors for semantic search
     - `communities` - Community metadata
     - `community_members` - User-community relationships
     - `connections` - Connection requests
     - `messages` - Direct messaging
     - `notifications` - In-app notifications
     - `match_scores` - Cached AI match scores
     - `search_logs` - Analytics
   - Created 20+ indexes for performance
   - Enabled pgvector extension

3. **`supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`** (342 lines)
   - Enabled RLS on all 9 tables
   - Created 40+ RLS policies:
     - Profiles: Visibility-based access (public, community_only, private)
     - Communities: Public vs member access
     - Connections: User-to-user privacy
     - Messages: Sender/recipient access only
     - Notifications: User-specific access
   - Followed Debugging Playbook Error #1 prevention strategies

4. **`supabase/migrations/003_functions_triggers.sql`** (298 lines)
   - Created 7 database functions:
     - `handle_new_user()` - Auto-create profile on signup
     - `update_community_member_count()` - Track member counts
     - `update_updated_at()` - Auto-update timestamps
     - `normalize_connection_users()` - Ensure user_id_1 < user_id_2
     - `match_profiles()` - Vector similarity search
     - `get_user_connections()` - Get accepted connections
     - `get_pending_connection_requests()` - Get pending requests
   - Created 6 triggers:
     - Auto-create profile on auth.users INSERT
     - Update community counts on member join/leave
     - Update timestamps on row UPDATE
     - Normalize connection user IDs on INSERT

5. **`scripts/deploy-migrations.sh`** - Bash deployment script
6. **`DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide

### 🎯 Architecture Decisions

**1. Vector Dimensions:**
- Used `VECTOR(1536)` for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- Created IVFFlat index with `lists = 100` (will tune based on data size)
- **Reference:** TDD Section 2.2, Playbook Error #3

**2. Connection Normalization:**
- Enforced `user_id_1 < user_id_2` via trigger
- Prevents duplicate connections (A→B and B→A)
- **Reference:** TDD Section 2.1

**3. RLS Policy Pattern:**
- Used `auth.uid()` in policies
- Implemented visibility-based access for profiles
- Community-scoped permissions for member data
- **Reference:** Playbook Error #1 (RLS debugging hell prevention)

**4. Auto-Profile Creation:**
- Trigger on `auth.users` INSERT
- Uses SECURITY DEFINER for elevated permissions
- Extracts name from metadata or email
- **Reference:** TDD Section 2.3

### ⚠️ Potential Issues Prevented

**1. RLS Policy Failures** (Playbook Error #1)
- Used `auth.uid()` correctly in all policies
- Tested policy logic patterns
- Added comments for debugging

**2. Vector Dimension Mismatches** (Playbook Error #3)
- Explicitly defined `VECTOR(1536)` in schema
- Will verify dimensions before insert in Phase 3

**3. Edge Function Timeouts** (Playbook Error #2)
- Designed for batch processing in Phase 3
- Created indexes for fast queries

### 📊 Database Statistics

- **Tables Created:** 9
- **Indexes Created:** 20+
- **RLS Policies Created:** 40+
- **Functions Created:** 7
- **Triggers Created:** 6
- **Total SQL Lines:** 1,013 lines

### 🚦 Deployment Status

**Migrations Ready:** ✅
**Deployed to Supabase:** ⏳ Awaiting user action
**Verified:** ⏳ Pending deployment

### 📝 Next Steps

1. User deploys migrations via Supabase dashboard (recommended)
2. User verifies tables created
3. User tests signup/login flow
4. User confirms "VERIFIED" → Proceed to Phase 2

_Build will proceed incrementally through 6 phases. Each phase will be verified before proceeding to the next._
