**Database Operations:**
```typescript
// Load settings
SELECT visibility, show_in_search FROM profiles WHERE user_id = ?

// Load communities
SELECT community_id, communities.name
FROM community_members
JOIN communities ON communities.id = community_members.community_id
WHERE user_id = ?

// Save settings
UPDATE profiles
SET visibility = ?, show_in_search = ?
WHERE user_id = ?
```

VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

// 2. Add creator as admin
INSERT INTO community_members (community_id, user_id, role)
VALUES (?, ?, 'admin')

```

## 📊 Database Schema Used

### Tables Updated:

**`profiles` table:**

**`communities` table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE communities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('public', 'private')),
  invite_code TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**`community_members` table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE community_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  community_id UUID REFERENCES communities(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'moderator', 'member')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
)
