# üîç Deployment Status Check

The test shows that functions aren't deployed yet. Let's verify what's actually deployed:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Test Results Show:

- ‚ùå Database: 500 error (might need migrations)
- ‚ùå All Edge Functions: 404 (not found)

This means either:
1. Migrations weren't run yet
2. Edge Functions weren't deployed yet
3. They were deployed with different names

---

## üîç Let's Check What You Did

### Did you deploy the **database migrations**?

**Go to SQL Editor:**
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mpztkfmhgbbidrylngbw/sql/new

**Run this:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

**If you see 9 tables:** ‚úÖ Database is deployed!
**If you see 0 tables:** ‚ùå Need to run migrations

---

### Did you deploy the **Edge Functions**?

**Go to Edge Functions:**
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mpztkfmhgbbidrylngbw/functions

**Check:**
- How many functions do you see?
- Are they "Active" or "Inactive"?
- What are their names?

**If you see 8 functions:** ‚úÖ Functions are deployed!
**If you see 0 functions:** ‚ùå Need to deploy functions

4. **Paste into SQL Editor**
5. **Click RUN**

**Expected:** "Success. No rows returned"

---

### Step 2: Deploy Each Edge Function

For each of these 8 functions:

1. **Go to Edge Functions** ‚Üí Click "Create a new function"
2. **Function name:** (exactly as shown below)
3. **Copy code from file** (shown below)
4. **Paste into editor**
5. **Click Deploy**

#### Function 1: get-profile
- **Name:** `get-profile` (with hyphen!)
- **File:** `supabase/functions/get-profile/index.ts`

#### Function 2: update-profile
- **Name:** `update-profile`

Run this to verify:
```bash
node scripts/test-deployment.js
```

Should show: ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED!

## üí° Common Issues

### Issue: "Function not found" (404)
**Reason:** Function name doesn't match code
**Solution:** Make sure function name matches exactly (with hyphens!)

### Issue: Database 500 error
**Reason:** Migrations not run
**Solution:** Run ALL_MIGRATIONS.sql in SQL Editor

### Issue: "Unauthorized" errors
**Reason:** API key not set or incorrect
**Solution:** Check Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Secrets

---

## üìû Tell Me:

1. **How many tables** do you see in Supabase Table Editor?
2. **How many Edge Functions** do you see in Edge Functions page?
3. **What are the function names** you deployed?

Then I can help you fix any issues!

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Commands (if you want to try again)

### For Database:
Copy-paste this entire file into SQL Editor:
